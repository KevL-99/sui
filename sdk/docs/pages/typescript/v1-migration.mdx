# Changes

## /bcs

### Types

- `SuiObjectRef`: removing bigint from `version` should we remove this completely
- `ObjectArg`: `ImmOrOwned` -> `ImmOrOwnedObject` and `Shared` -> `SharedObject`
- Added `ObjectCallArg`
- `PureArg` Changed ArrayLike to Array not sure if this is correct

### Bcs Types

- `CallArg` removed `ObjVec`
- `Argument` enumKind to enum\, Removed nested structs to align with Rust definitions
- `ProgrammableMoveCall` Split target into `package`\, `module` and `function`\, typeArguments now
  TypeTag instead of String
- `Transaction` enumKind to enum\, replaced nested structs with tuples to align with Rust
  definitions

## /transactions

### Types

- `TransactionObjectArgument` shape changed
- `TransactionResult` shape changed
- `TransactionObjectInput` shape changed
- `TransactionArgument` shape changed
- `TransactionBlockInput` shape changed

### TransactionBlock

- `blockData` is deprecated\, returns snapshot of v1 blockData\, should this be removed?
- added getBlockData that returns new v2 blockData

## /utils

Removed `is` and `assert` helpers

## /mutltisig

- publicKeyFromSuiBytes moved to /verify

# TODO

- Remove Input and Transaction exports?
- Move helpers in inputs.ts
- `getPureSerializationType` should be replaced
- Should remove legacy BCS registry
- Should remove BCS registry name exports
- TransactionBlock constructor args?
- Remove pure inputs without types
- Need to export types for blockData
- Remove all type-exports from bcs\, only export export implementations and helper types to get type
  from implementation
- Serialize should be updated to allow exporting v2 state
- Define TypeTag output type rather than input type?
- Use valibot parser in TypeTagSerializer
- Figure out what bcs should still export
- cleanup typescript/bcs exports
- maybe remove intent exports from cryptography and just use bcs intent encoding/decoding directly
- Should fromB64, toB64, fromHEX, toHEX still be exported from utils?
